## A final year undergraduate group project

The VR Car Dealership was created by a group of final year students as part of contious assesment for the module "Designing for virtual enviornments". 

The idea for a car dealership spawned after some discussion between the members the team, after carefully studying the requirements for the project. It was discovered that creating a car dealership would in fact, meet all of the requirements for the project.

## Requirements

The project required features such as:

- Some Models.
- A form of navigation.
- Collisions between objects.
- The ability to interact with the enviornment.
- A user interface.
- A "Special Feature" (Some feature that went beyond the scope of the requirements).


### Models

The first challenge was the models. The group needed to create models and find models online that would run on a mid-range mobile device. This ultimately meant, an environment with a low poly count. The vehicles, and other models would need to be quite minimal in terms of detail for this to work. The team kept this in mind and discussed what models would be suitable for use in the environment. The team was able to develop some models for use in the environment, as well as source some of the more difficult models to create, on the web.
### Navigation

It had been mentioned in one of the earlier lectures that teleportation could be used to navigate the environment. However, upon further research, this didnâ€™t seem feasible, nor necessary. Thankfully, the assignments covered gazed based movement, which sufficed for what the group needed to accomplish.

### Collision

The solution was to rename the text labels, allowing the text to be modified based on the interaction component discussed in the lab. When a user enters a collision body, the text is changed, based on the box that was entered.

### User Interface

To provide a user interface, the solution was to rename the text labels, provided by the labratory sessions, allowing the text to be modified based on the interaction component discussed in the lab. When a user enters a collision body, the text is changed, based on the box that was entered.
### Interaction

Scripts provided during labratory sessions gave a method of interaction using collision based interaction with "triggers". Attaching scripts to buttons that the user can walk over, will trigger that script and the desired function to execute.
### Special Features

Each of the cars have the option to change it's colour before purchasing. The scripts in helped facilitate this, in combination with adding buttons on the floor, with collisions and the interaction features described above. The material / colour is saved on the relevant button. When the user enters the collision, the car changes to that colour. 
### Conclusion

The group worked very well together and there were no stresses in getting everything done in time. Each team member played their part and had some laughs along the way. It showed that a group can come together and build something really fun, and engaging in a short space of time if they work together.
